## Preparing Your Bot
You will need to own a Discord Bot ready with a token. Do not use a bot you do not own, and do not use a bot that already has another purpose. Try to create a new bot for this.
![Application Example](https://discordjs.guide/assets/create-app.ed82aede.png)
Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create a New Application

- Find the "Bot" tab on the left side and click "Add Bot"

- In the "Bot" tab, click "Reset Token" and copy it. You will need this to run your bot.

- Find the "OAuth2" tab and go to "URL Generator"

- Under "scopes" select "bot"

- Under "bot permissions" you can just select "Administrator"

- Copy the Generated URL and open it to invite the bot to a server you manage and feel comfortable having the bot in. You can always kick the bot after you get the badge.

## How to Use It
- Git Clone this repository or download it

- Open it, preferably with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

- Edit the YourOwnBot.java file and replace the "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" with your Discord Bot Token.

- Run the YourOwnBot.java file(its main method)

- Go to the Discord server you added your bot to

- Use the /badge command that's from your bot

- Wait about 24 hours for Discord to recognize your bot and global command.

- Visit the [Active Developer Badge Page](https://discord.com/developers/active-developer) to claim your badge
